# Hasn't this been done before?

[Live demo](https://life.jovianmoon.io)

Yes, a ton of times.

I had youtube on in the background the other day and I heard [The Primeagen](https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen) say something along the lines of "I've never built the game of life... maybe I should do that."

I said to myself "Hey! I've been wanting to do that too!"

So I did.

## A few of my goals:

- No dependencies past the SvelteKit skeleton project selections (typescript + prettier)
- Utilize Svelte's features (components, derived stores, etc)
- Make it interactive (you can draw on the game board to change the state live!)
- A fluid game board / clean responsive design
- Has to run well enough
- Didn't want to use `<canvas>` or any rendering libraries

If you like my effort, give me a star :)
